# CS589-Car-Classification
Final Project CS589 - Using ConvNets with Theano to classify cars into types/makes/models.

Goals of the project:

To use a Convolutional Neural Network based model to classify car images from various sources
for type/model/make of vehicle. We will use training/testing data sets that will be comprised
of images from netcarshow, KBB, and NADAGuides. To implement the ConvNets, we will use Theano,
feature selection will also be taken care of using theano. Ultimately, parallelizing the data-set
will allow for faster training/greater accuracy of the ConvNet. We will be updating this repo as
developments are made in training the model.
